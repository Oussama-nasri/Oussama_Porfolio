# [Project 1: SMART ESPRIT](https://github.com/Oussama-nasri/Smart-Esprit)

![](images/logo_final.png)
* Created a Platform that Manages the main functions needed to be performed by esprit administrators:
1.  the administrator  manages the users
2.  the technician to manage the sensors
3.  the nutritionist to manage the weekly menus
4.  the hostel agent to manage the hosted students
5.  the restaurant agent to manage the stock
6.  students to request food or accommodation services

Project:

1 - Business Understanding:

Define the project's objectives and goals.

Understand the significance of detecting CKD early.

Identify key stakeholders and their requirements.

2 - Data Understanding:

Gather relevant CKD-related datasets.

Explore the data to understand its structure and content.

Identify the features (variables) available in the dataset.

Check for data quality issues such as missing values and outliers.

Understand the distribution of target labels (CKD or non-CKD).

Data Preparation:

Handle missing data by imputation or removal.

Address outliers through data preprocessing techniques.

Perform data scaling or normalization as necessary.

Encode categorical variables if present.

Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

Modeling:

Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVM).

Train multiple models using the training data.

Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

Consider techniques like feature selection to improve model interpretability.

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Evaluation:

Assess the model's performance on the validation set.

Compare different models and select the best-performing one.

Use relevant evaluation metrics, considering the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives.

Visualize model performance using ROC curves, confusion matrices, etc.

Consider performing cross-validation to estimate model generalization.

Deployment:

Deploy the selected model in a real-world setting  : local web application
